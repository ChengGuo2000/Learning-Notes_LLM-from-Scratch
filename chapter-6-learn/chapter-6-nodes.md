## Fine-tuning
- **Instruction fune-tuning** involves training a language model on a set of tasks using specific instructions to improve its ability to understand and execute tasks described in natural language prompts. It typically can undertake a broader range of tasks.
- **Classification fine-tuning** is hwen the model is trained to recognize a specific set of class labels. It is restricted to predicting classes it has encountered during its training, so it is highly specialized.
- **Instruction fine-tuning** improves the model's ability to understand and generate responses based on specific user instructions. It is best suited for models that need to handle a variety of tasks. It demands larger datasets and greater computational resources to develop models proficient in various tasks.
- **Classification fine-tuning** is ideal for projects requiring precise categorization of data into predefined classes. It requires less data and compute power, but it is confined to the specific classes it trained on.
